## üìù Description
This extension was made using the awesome [React boilerplace](https://github.com/ElForastero/react-browser-extension-boilerplate) from [@ElForastero](https://github.com/ElForastero)

## üèÅ Install & Contribution

clone this project

then:

```sh
cd block-sites-react-extension

yarn watch
```

Runs webpack in watch mode. Automatically reloads the page after changes in files. Thanks to [webpack-extension-reloader](https://github.com/rubenspgcavalcante/webpack-extension-reloader).

```sh
yarn build
```

Builds the extension in production mode. This version can be shipped to the store.

## How to increment version

Use [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) cli command to bump a version of your package.json. The version of manifest will stay in sync with version specified in package.json.

For example:

```sh
npm version patch
```

This will increase your patch package.json version. During the next build output manifest file will have the same version.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Security Policy (CSP)
"unsafe-eval" in directive "script-src" and "connect-src" are needed for auto reloading, and should be removed from production manifest.json.
