> This project aims to provide a simple boilerplate for writing browser extensions for the most popular browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, new Edge and other Chromium-based browsers.

## üéâ Features

- **Preact X or React** (you can switch them easily in webpack config)
- **Shadow DOM** for injected content
- **Styled-Components**
- **Auto reloading** (there's no need to manually reload extension)
- Ready-to-go setup with **internationalization**

## üë®‚Äçüíª Examples

You can look at [Framer](https://github.com/ElForastero/framer) todo list extension as an example of using this boilerplate. There are no straight restrictions on how to use it, or any limitations on tools and technologies. Think of it as a regular react application with some special properties.

## üìù Description

It's built with `preact` and `preact-compat` which allows you to switch between `react` and `preact`.

Content and styles which are injected directly to the page, are isolated inside Shadow DOM.

## üèÅ Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ElForastero/react-browser-extension-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

## üöÄ Usage

```sh
yarn watch
```

Runs webpack in watch mode. Automatically reloads the page after changes in files. Thanks to [webpack-extension-reloader](https://github.com/rubenspgcavalcante/webpack-extension-reloader).

```sh
yarn build
```

Builds the extension in production mode. This version can be shipped to the store.

## How to increment version

Use [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) cli command to bump a version of your package.json. The version of manifest will stay in sync with version specified in package.json.

For example:

```sh
npm version patch
```

This will increase your patch package.json version. During the next build output manifest file will have the same version.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Security Policy (CSP)
"unsafe-eval" in directive "script-src" and "connect-src" are needed for auto reloading, and should be removed from production manifest.json.
